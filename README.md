# ros_arm_kinematics
ROS based robotic arm kinematics. A simulation of an arm in the environment with obstacles. 

Plan:
#### step 1
* build a mathematical model for a two joint arm
* implement the model via ros & gazeba tools
* test performance
#### step 2
* build a more sophisticated mathematical model for a real world arm
* implement the model via ros & gazeba tools
* test performance 

```
[ ] architecture of an arm
[ ] transformation matrices
[ ] Jacobians
```
