# ros_arm_kinematics
ROS based robotic arm kinematics. A simulation of an arm in the environment with obstacles. 

Plan:
* build a mathematical model for a two joint arm
* implement the model via ros & gazeba tools
* test performance
* build a more sophisticated model for a real world arm 

* architecture of an arm
* transformation matrices
* Jacobians
